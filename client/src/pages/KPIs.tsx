                In this survey, we asked respondents to provide their most recent percentage figures for annual sickness lost time rate (LTR), calculated as total absence (hours or days) in a year divided by the total possible total (hours or days) in a year.

                We were also interested in gathering information on respondents' annual employee turnover rate (global) over the past two years, understood as the number of employees who have left over the year for any reason.

                  From the five organisations that were able to provide the Global Annual Employee Turnover rate as a percentage across both years, we find that all five experienced a decline in turnover rate from the previous year. The other three organisations commented that they also experienced a decline in turnover rate compared to the previous year. This shows that, across-the-board, turnover rate has decreased for all participating organisations in this year's survey.

                <p className="mb-3">
                  Four organisations provided data on voluntary annual employee turnover rates: three report a decrease from 2022/23 to 2023/24, which aligns with the overall downward trend observed in global turnover rates. One organisation noted a slight increase in voluntary turnover, rising from 9.7% to 10.4%, indicating that the rate has remained relatively stable over the years.
                </p>
                
                <p className="mb-3">
                  Two additional organisations confirmed a decline in voluntary turnover, further reinforcing the overall trend of decreasing turnover rates within this sample.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                  When comparing voluntary turnover rates to global turnover rates, both appear relatively similar. However, the data reveals that two organisations experienced an increase in voluntary turnover from 2022/23 to 2023/24, whereas all organisations reported a decrease in their global turnover rates. This suggests that while overall turnover is declining, voluntary turnover trends may still vary depending on organisational circumstances.

                Another key performance indicator which this survey explores is respondents' annual conflict index; that is, the number of staff who have been subject to formal disciplinary or capability proceedings (not including sickness) or raised a grievance. We asked for this to be expressed as a percentage of the total average number of staff employed over the year.

Two other organisations also declared that the annual conflict index decreased from 2022/23 to 2023/34.

                  The trend for annual payroll spent on temporary staff is rather mixed within our sample of organisations. Three of nine (33%) organisations presented a percentage decrease in costs from 2022/23 to 2023/24; while two organisations noted a significant increase, another has experienced agency costs almost quadrupling. Two other organisations stated that agency costs had decreased while one other stated a general increase.
