Prompt: Build a Salary Survey Insights Dashboard (Housing Associations)
Goal
Create a modern, professional web app that lets housing associations compare pay and reward data across organisations. The app must be accurate, user-friendly, and cover: Overview, Reflections on Pay, Core Benefits, Pay Frameworks, Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), National Minimum/Living Wage, and Rates of Pay for Key Roles with a scrollable + searchable table. Base content on the figures below.
Audience
HR/Reward leaders in supported housing/housing associations.
Tech & UX Requirements
Stack (preferred): React + Vite + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui + TanStack Table (v8) + Recharts.
Styling: Dark blue base with gold highlights.
--brand-dark: #0B2C54; (primary backgrounds, headings)
--brand-gold: #D4AF37; (accents, active states)
--brand-slate: #0E1A2B; (alt background)
Use system font stack, high contrast, WCAG AA.
Layout: Top nav with product title + org selector; left rail for section navigation; right side content. Mobile-first responsive.
Components: KPI cards, comparison filters, segmented controls, tabs, data table with column filters, CSV export, and “definitions” popovers for jargon.
Performance & UX: Client-side routing; persistent filters in URL query; sticky table header; virtualized rows for large tables; keyboard navigation; aria labels.

Overview
KPI summary cards (totals/medians across the sample):
“All participants implemented a 2024 pay rise” ✔
Pay increases ranged 2.1% to 7.1%+; lower-paid roles prioritised.
55.6% plan a consolidated increase in 2025 (22.2% undecided).

67% offer healthcare benefits.
All organisations reported decline in global turnover vs last year.
Annual conflict index largely 3–8%.
44% will be impacted by NLW rise to £12.21.
89% have adopted/plan to adopt Real or London Living Wage.
Include tooltips linking to the relevant section. Data points provided in the “Data Appendix” below.
Filters at top: Region (London / Outside / Both), Organisation multi-select, and a “Reset” button.
Reflections on Pay (Market Overview & Forecasts)
Short narrative callout explaining: bottom-of-market uplift from NLW/LLW, ripple effects into £22k–£32k band (≈7% at Senior Support level over 18 months), and skewing downwards for senior roles; CPI ≈2.3%, rates ≈4.75%, earnings growth ≈5.2% (Jul–Sep 2024).
Two visualizations:
“Bottom vs Manager level pay trend” (explainer chart made from the summary text).
“Forecast pay rises 2025” (banded range 2–4%).
Keep these charts clearly labelled as contextual insights.
Core Benefits
Tabs: Holiday, Pension, Sickness, Wellbeing/Healthcare, Family Leave.
Show the % providing each feature with concise bullets (e.g., buy/sell leave = 44%; healthcare benefits = 67%). Include examples (e.g., health cash plans, EAP, enhanced maternity). Add an “Examples” accordion.
Pay Frameworks
Chips showing framework prevalence: pay spine, broad-banded, job families, market ranges.
Small table breaking down popularity by location and by size (<250 vs 250+).
KPIs
Multi-series small multiples or separate charts for:
Sickness LTR YoY
Global turnover YoY
Voluntary turnover YoY
Conflict index (distribution)
% payroll spent on agency (2022/23 vs 2023/24)
Use organisation filter + region toggle; legend + download as PNG/CSV.
National Minimum Wage & Living Wage
Highlight cards:
NLW (Apr 2025) £12.21 → £23,809 for 37.5h/week.
LLW £13.85 → £27,007 for 37.5h/week.
Tiles: 44% impacted by NLW; 89% adopted/plan RLW/LLW; notes on strategies (e.g., adjusting grades above NLW).
Short explainer on differentials compression and response options.
Rates of Pay for Key Roles (Flagship table)
Scrollable, searchable, filterable table with sticky header; supports:
Role quick search (fuzzy), Region filter (Total / Inside London / Outside London / Wider Market), and min/max for quartiles.
Columns: Role, Geography, Sample, LQ, Median, UQ, Average.
Row grouping by role; expandable to see all geographies per role.
CSV export of filtered view.
Provide a “Glossary” tooltip for LQ/Median/UQ.
Add “Compare roles” drawer: select up to 3 roles to plot Median bars side-by-side (with geography toggle).
Seed data (from the SSHR Pay Benchmark Group Report 2024/25)
Use these exact figures to populate the demo (aggregate-level, not per-org). The sample includes nine organisations; turnover £4.3m–£70m; median headcount 600; geography mix: 2 London-only, 1 South East-only (outside London), 6 both; working week: four at 37.5h, one at 39h, one at 40h, three vary 35–39h.
Summary metrics
2024 pay awards: all 9 gave an award; ranges 2.1% to 7.1%+; fixed NJC amounts for some London roles £1,575 inner / £1,491 outer; lower-paid prioritised. 2025 consolidated: 55.6% yes, 22.2% undecided, 22.2% no. Unconsolidated 2025: 77.8% no, 22.2% undecided.
Overtime: 78% weekday no enhancement; 22% enhanced. Weekends 67% standard; 33% enhanced (time-and-a-half to double time). Sleep-in examples: 0.2× hourly, £30.24, £61.50. On-call allowances: structured £20–£80 per shift; holiday/emergency enhancements noted.
Core benefits: 25 days starting leave most common; 30 days typical max; 44% buy/sell leave; 67% healthcare benefits (cash plans, PMI, eye tests, life assurance/critical illness in some). Sick pay medians ≈ 6 weeks full + 6 weeks half; max often 13 + 13 after tenure. All DC pensions; some matching up to 7.5–8%.
Pay frameworks: mix of pay spine, broad-banded, job families, market spot ranges; larger/London orgs skew to pay spine/market ranges.
KPIs: all orgs reported decline in global turnover vs prior year; conflict index mostly 3–8%; agency spend trend mixed.
Wages: NLW £12.21 (Apr 2025) → £23,809 for 37.5h; LLW £13.85 → £27,007 for 37.5h; 44% impacted by NLW; 89% adopted/plan RLW/LLW.

(Implement the remainder exactly per the report figures provided; the app should make it easy to extend this JSON.)
Interactions & polish
Global org filter: when none selected, show aggregate figures; when >0 selected, recompute KPIs and cards on the fly (client-side).
“Download” actions: CSV for tables, PNG for charts.
Empty states with clear copy.
Inline definitions for “LQ/Median/UQ”, “LTR”, “Global vs Voluntary turnover”.
Footer: source note “SSHR Pay Benchmark Group Report (2024/25) – TwentySix Consulting”.
Acceptance criteria
Navigation: all 7 sections present and working.
At least 10 KPI/metric callouts populated with the numbers above.
Rates of Pay table: scrollable, searchable (fuzzy), column filters, CSV export, sticky header, virtualized rows.
Theming matches dark blue + gold; responsive on mobile/desktop; meets basic a11y checks.
No backend required; bundle the data as local JSON or TypeScript constant. (Optional: add a tiny Node/Express endpoint if needed.)
Nice-to-haves (if time allows)
Org comparator: select 2–3 org archetypes to compare KPIs (mock categories if per-org data isn’t available).
“What changed vs last year?” snapshot cards on KPIs.
If you want, I can also generate a ready-to-run starter (React + Vite + Tailwind + shadcn) with the data JSON wired into the pages above.
